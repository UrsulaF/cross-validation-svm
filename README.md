# Wine Classification with SVM and Cross-Validation

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project focuses on applying Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to a wine classification dataset using the `sklearn` library. The main objective is to compare model performance with and without cross-validation, emphasizing how cross-validation enhances our understanding of model accuracy and robustness.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Implement a SVM model for wine classification.
- Evaluate the model's performance using standard train/test splits versus cross-validation.
- Analyze how cross-validation helps in measuring and improving model performance.
